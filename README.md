<h1>The ABC order isn't the only order. They say that there is no "correct order" to the alphabet. Any order is the correct order. This program, it generates absolutely correct and acceptable ABC orders. OWY order, perhaps? Maybe OQH order? MFG order? They're all acceptable orders.</h1>
<h2>There are 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 ways to arrange the alphabet. That's 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 combinations this program can create. That's about a one in 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 chance that you would generate the normal alphabet with this. That's a 2.47959626e-27 chance that you would generate the original alphabet. The most common alphabet configuration.</h2>
